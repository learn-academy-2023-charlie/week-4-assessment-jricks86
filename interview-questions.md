# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming that utilizes classes and objects to achieve a specific purpose.

Researched answer: Object-oriented programming (OOP). OOP is a programming paradigm, which deals with creating objects with methods, which can be defined and used as sub-objects. In OOP, methods are contained within objects, with each object having a collection of methods. It utilizes inheritance to derive new types from existing types.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: A float is a number with a decimal point, while an integer is a number without a decimal point.

Researched answer: The difference between a float and an integer is that the integer is a whole number, while the float is a fractional number. 

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: Implicit return means that you do not have to include the word "return" in your function to receive an output.

Researched answer: The return of a function from another function within the same module, class or program is called a "return". Ruby has an implicit return, and you can “return” from a method without a return statement. Ruby also has a similar concept for top-level statements like classes and modules.


4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: Code that accepts input from arguments and returns a value.

Researched answer: A block is a series of statements connected by curly braces. Ruby blocks allow for code reuse and modularization. Ruby blocks allow for more concise code. Ruby blocks are useful for scoping and for creating reusable code.

5. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: Putting the defined value in bracket notation.

Researched answer: You extract a value in a Ruby hash by “binding” it in a block. Ruby hashes also allow for multiple values to be extracted.
